# WSP2agent
modular Python agent that runs a controlled web sweep (SerpApi), scrapes listing pages, extracts contacts, curates a Top-10, generates one personalized PDF per target, prepares send-ready emails, sends a small test batch via Gmail API, and monitors replies — with a manual approval gate before any outbound sends.
