Winter Haven affordable housing inquiry — reliable tenant with yard care skills

### Body:
```
Hi,

I'm Robert, looking for an affordable room or studio in Winter Haven (33880). My budget is $400–$700/month. I'm a responsible tenant who pays on time, keeps things tidy, and can offer 6–10 hours/week of garden/yard care (I bring seeds and maintain flower and vegetable beds) plus light home/tech help if that would be useful.

I'm open to a modest rent credit if that helps. Happy to meet today and share references.

I saw your Winter Haven listings here: https://www.apartmenthomeliving.com/apartment-finder/Winter-Haven-FL

Looking forward to hearing from you!
